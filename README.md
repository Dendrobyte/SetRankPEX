# SetRankPEX 2.0

## PermissionsEx is an old plugin, but many of us are hesitant to switch to something like LuckPerms* There's a plugin called SetRankPEX that makes it much easier to rank players, but it's quite outdated (1.7.9!) So... I re-wrote it! See the link below, idea credit to original author, Irock23!

### Commands
- /setrank <player> <rank> - Sets a player to a given rank
  - Alias: /rank
  - Please note the rank doesn't have to exist (PEX is too outdated to properly check that sort of stuff efficiently, haha...) <br>

- /setrankhelp - Displays the help menu
  - Alias: /srhelp <br>

- /setrankreload
  - Alias: /srreload



### Permissions
- setrank.base - Base permission needed for primary check, you need to add this!attachFull365552
- srpex.rankto.groupName - Allows a player to rank someone TO the given groupName (e.g. srpex.rankto.Admin) attachFull365554 
- srpex.rankfrom.groupName - Allows a player to rank someone FROM the given groupName (e.g. srpex.rankfrom.visitor)attachFull365553
- srpex.reload - Reloads the configuration file
- srpex.* - All permissions!

*I do not recommend continuing to use PermissionsEx and to indeed switch to LuckPerms, but if you're like me and are pushing it off and are tired of the old SetRankPEX's error messages, here you go!
